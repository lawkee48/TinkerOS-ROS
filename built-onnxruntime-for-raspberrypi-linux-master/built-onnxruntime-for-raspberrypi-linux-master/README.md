The project does not provide pre-built packages for Raspbery Pi Linux 32bit (ARM32v7) as of today. Instead it has an instruction on [how to build ONNX Runtime from the source code](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/master/BUILD.md).

Building packages takes 5-6 hours of time. This repository provides pre-built Python ONNX Runtime packages for Raspberry pi for convenience.

There is NO WARRANTY of any kind at all.
